# About Me
Hello! I am IB.
I like to listen to music and play video games with my friends. One of my goals are that I want to graduate high school. Another goal is that I want a high paying job that I actually have an actual interest in.

**My Lifestyle & Career Alignment Research**
I plan to live in Las Vegas in a 2-story, 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom house, which I would rent due to high home prices. I'll drive an Infiniti (G37 or similar), using monthly payments, insurance, and premium gas. Monthly utilities will cost around $300, groceries $1,180, and health insurance about $488. I'll spend on entertainment ($75/month) and travel occasionally, mainly to Mexico ($250/month). I will pursue an HVAC certification ($10,000–$20,000), and aim to save 20% of my income each month.

Estimated Costs:

Estimated Monthly Cost: $6,993
Estimated Annual Cost: $71,916
Required Gross Annual Salary (with cushion): $89,895

Top Career Choice:

My top career choice is being a beat producer because it combines my passion for music with creative freedom. IM already learning how to make beats and flip samples, which makes the work both fun and fulfilling. It aligns with my lifestyle goals since making music has always been a dream of mines. Skills from this course like collaboration will help me work with other small artists or producers, and my problem-solving skills will assist with the technical side of music production and creativity.
